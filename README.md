# projectile-motion-simulation
This project uses laws of kinematics to simulate the trajectory of a projectile under the influence of gravity, based on user-defined initial conditions. It provides a graphical visualization of the motion.

## Features

- Customizable initial velocity and launch angle.
- Adjustable simulation time and time resolution.
- Interactive plot of the projectile's trajectory.
- Real-time filtering of invalid inputs for a smooth user experience.

## How to use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using: %pip install numpy matplotlib
3. Run the script:
4. Follow the prompts to input:
- Initial velocity (m/s)
- Launch angle (degrees)
- Total simulation time (seconds)
- Number of time steps

## Example input:

- Enter the initial velocity (m/s): 20
- Enter the launch angle (degrees): 45
- Enter the total simulation time (seconds): 5
- Enter the number of time steps: 100

## Example Output

Hereâ€™s an example of the projectile's trajectory with labeled axes and key parameters, when the input is as example input:
